# 👁️ VISION

Cancer is one of the most significant challenges of our time, and we believe that AI holds the key to addressing it. However, this solution should be accessible and free for everyone. Machine vision technology has long proven effective in early diagnosis, which is crucial for curing cancer. Yet, until now, it has largely remained in the realm of whitepapers. SAFESCAN is a project dedicated to aggregating and enhancing the best algorithms for detecting various types of cancer and providing free computational power for practical cancer detection. We aim to create open-source products that support cancer diagnosis for both patients and doctors.

To date, many crypto and AI projects, particularly those focused on medicine, have struggled to achieve real-world implementation due to various barriers. Our solution focuses on:

**🛠️ Development of Applications and Software:** Invest in the ongoing development and enhancement of our cancer detection applications and software to ensure they are at the cutting edge of technology.

**📝 Medical Device Registration:** Allocate funds to cover the costs associated with registering our solutions as medical devices, ensuring they meet all regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy.

**📢 Marketing and Awareness:** Implement comprehensive marketing strategies to raise awareness about our solutions and Bittensor project, making them known to both potential users and healthcare professionals.

**🤝 Collaboration and Networking:** Build strong networks with cancer organizations, researchers, and healthcare providers to facilitate the practical implementation and continuous improvement of our technology.

**📈Continuous Improvement of Algorithms:** Reward top researchers, maintain algorithms in the open domain, and constantly expand our anonymized cancer detection dataset through partnerships and user contributions.

**⚖️ Legislative Efforts:** Engage in legislative activities to support the recognition and adoption of AI-driven cancer detection technologies within the medical community.

By focusing on these areas, we aim to overcome the barriers to the practical use of AI in cancer detection and provide a solution that is accessible to everyone.

To expedite the process and navigate the complexities of medical certification, we are beginning our initiatives with authorized clinical trials. After completing clinical trials of our first project, **SELFSCAN** – an application for detecting skin cancer through self-made pictures – we will focus on its deployment as a Class II medical device in the USA and Europe, obtaining the necessary FDA and CE approvals.

Concurrently, with the help of the Bittensor community and our unique tokenomics supporting researchers, we will continuously improve the best cancer detection algorithms. This ensures that, by the time our products are brought to market, our solutions surpass all existing algorithms.

Subsequently, we will focus on detecting other types of cancer, starting with breast and lung cancer.

# **🌍 REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS**

Our SKIN SCAN app, accessible at [www.skin-scan.ai](http://www.skin-scan.ai/), is designed to bridge the gap between AI's proven efficiency in cancer detection and its limited real-world application. Despite numerous studies validating AI's potential in cancer detection, its use in everyday healthcare is still not widespread. Our app aims to change this by providing a user-friendly, accessible tool for early skin cancer detection.

Building on this foundation, we are developing dedicated software for breast cancer detection, utilizing advanced AI to offer accurate assessments. Following this, we will expand our focus to include lung and brain cancer detection solutions, aiming to make these life-saving technologies widely available and effective in clinical settings.

SAFE SCAN harnesses the power of the Bittensor network to address one of the world's most pressing issues: cancer detection. Researchers can contribute to refining detection algorithms and earn TAO, with additional royalties for those whose algorithms are integrated into our software. By focusing on obtaining large datasets, including paid and hard-to-access medical data, we ensure the development of superior models. Our decentralized, transparent system guarantees fair competition and protects against model overfitting. With strong community and validator support, we can expand to create and register standalone software for detecting other types of cancer. 

Additionally with Safe Scan, we can significantly broaden awareness of Bittensor's capabilities and resonate with a more general audience. This will be crucial for the network's growth and increasing market cap, attracting both large and microinvestors.

# 📢 MARKETING

Our first goal is to develop the best skin cancer detection algorithm and establish ourselves as a recognized leader in cancer detection. We aim not only to create the most popular and widely accessible skin cancer detection app but also to demonstrate Bittensor's power. We plan to spread awareness through partnerships with skin cancer foundations, growth hacking strategies like affiliate links for unlocking premium features, and promotional support from Apple and Google stores, aiming to reach over 1 million users within 18 months.  And every app launch will display “proudly powered by BITTENSOR.”

However, brand recognition is just the beginning. Our marketing strategy will focus on creating hype by engaging bloggers, reaching to celebrities affected by skin cancer, and sending articles to major tech, health, and news outlets. We will leverage the current interest in AI and blockchain to showcase the life-saving potential of these technologies. 

# 💰 TOKENOMY & ECONOMY

**🪙 UNIQUE TOKENOMY**

Our tokenomics are uniquely designed to drive research and development of new algorithms while also supporting real-life applications.

**Incentives**: Miners with the best-performing algorithms in our ongoing competitions are rewarded through our leaderboard system. The top-ranked miner receives significant incentives, promoting continuous improvement and innovation.

**Royalties**: Miners whose algorithms are integrated into our app and software for real-life cancer detection applications earn additional  1% of emission royalties. This ensures ongoing motivation for developers to create cutting-edge solutions that contribute to our mission of saving lives

**📈 SELF-SUSTAINING ECONOMY**

Although our primary focus is on using our subnet to save lives with state-of-the-art algorithms and custom-made software while promoting the power of Bittensor computing worldwide, our long-term goal is to establish a self-sustaining economy.

# **📊 SETUP WandB (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - VALIDATORS PLEASE READ)**

Before running your miner and validator, you may also choose to set up Weights & Biases (WANDB). It is a popular tool for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments, and we use it for logging and tracking key metrics across miners and validators, all of which is available publicly [here](https://wandb.ai/shr1ftyy/sturdy-subnet/table?nw=nwusershr1ftyy). We ***highly recommend*** validators use wandb, as it allows subnet developers and miners to diagnose issues more quickly and effectively, say, in the event a validator were to be set abnormal weights. Wandb logs are collected by default, and done so in an anonymous fashion, but we recommend setting up an account to make it easier to differentiate between validators when searching for runs on our dashboard. If you would *not* like to run WandB, you can do so by adding the flag `--wandb.off` when running your miner/validator.

Before getting started, as mentioned previously, you'll first need to [register](https://wandb.ai/login?signup=true) for a WANDB account, and then set your API key on your system. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this on Ubuntu:

**Step 1: Installation of WANDB**

Before logging in, make sure you have the WANDB Python package installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:

```
# Should already be installed with the sturdy repo
pip install wandb
```

**Step 2: Obtain Your API Key**

1. Log in to your Weights & Biases account through your web browser.
2. Go to your account settings, usually accessible from the top right corner under your profile.
3. Find the section labeled "API keys".
4. Copy your API key. It's a long string of characters unique to your account.

**Step 3: Setting Up the API Key in Ubuntu**

To configure your WANDB API key on your Ubuntu machine, follow these steps:

1. **Log into WANDB**: Run the following command in the terminal:
    
    ```
    wandb login
    ```
    
2. **Enter Your API Key**: When prompted, paste the API key you copied from your WANDB account settings.
    - After pasting your API key, press `Enter`.
    - WANDB should display a message confirming that you are logged in.
3. **Verifying the Login**: To verify that the API key was set correctly, you can start a small test script in Python that uses WANDB. If everything is set up correctly, the script should run without any authentication errors.
4. **Setting API Key Environment Variable (Optional)**: If you prefer not to log in every time, you can set your API key as an environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:
    
    ```
    echo 'export WANDB_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
    Replace `your_api_key` with the actual API key. This method automatically authenticates you with wandb every time you open a new terminal session.
